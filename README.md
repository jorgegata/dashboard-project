# Project DASHBOARD

The repository contains the necessary code to load, clean, transform, and display various metrics related to the VBZ transport system of ZÃ¼rich. It automatizes the workflow considering the data pipeline presented 
The datasets may be given to the tool using the data scheme modelled by the Open Government Data (OGD) at the Open Data Portal (https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/vbz_fahrgastzahlen_ogd) in zip format containing CSV files for each year of analysis.

## Structure of the repository

* documentation: contains information about metadata, tables and data scheme used by VBZ to gather the data
* streamlit_app: contains the files needed to display the dashboard, implemented in the streamlit python package.
    - streamlit_app/data: temporal folder to store intermediate data
    - output: processed csv files to check the output of the transformation, as well as to export the processed data
    - pages: python files containing the logic and layout of multiple pages in the dashboard
    - utils: python files containing functions, constants, and other objects to implement the dashboard
    - main.py: python file containing the main page of the dashboard
